            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: A comparison of CFDA obligations and USASpending.gov obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>Completeness</strong>: A measure of how many required fields are completed. </li>
                <li><strong>Timeliness</strong>: A measure of how quickly obligations were reported.</li>
