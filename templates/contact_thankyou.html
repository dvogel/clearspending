            <h3>Our Metrics</h3>
            <p class="no-border">How did we conduct our analysis and what assumptions did we make? What limitations exist with the comparison data we're using? We measured the data across three categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: A comparison of CFDA obligations and USASpending.gov obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>Completeness</strong>: A measure of how many required fields are compelted. </li>
                <li><strong>Timeliness</strong>: A measure of how quickly obligations were reported.</li>
            </ul>
