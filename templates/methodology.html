<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>
USASpending.gov reports two main spending types: contracts and direct spending. The amounts under these two types of spending are collected using to two very different reporting systems. One reporting system is called <a href="{% url background %}">FAADS, (Federal Awards and Assistance Data System) and the other is FPDS (Federal Procurement Data System)</a>. For the purposes of this analysis, we have focused exclusively on FAADS, the dataset that only contains information on direct spending. Direct spending being grants, direct payments, loans and loan guarantees. The data we used for this analysis was originally provided to us in April of 2010 on a hard drive by engineers who maintain USASpending.gov. Updates to the data will occur on a regular basis using the recently launched USASpending.gov API.
</p>

<p>
Each metric required unique methodology and datasets, but mostly relied on data from the USASpending site itself. In addition to that data, we used yearly program obligation estimates provided in the Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA). The CFDA is published online and contains spending estimates for the most recent three fiscal years for all grant and loan programs. It also serves as the de facto reporting unit for direct spending on the federal level. While budget authorizations and appropriations are decided through the legislation process for broad program areas, federal agencies exercise their own discretion in breaking funds out in to smaller, more specific, CFDA programs. There is no clear link between budget appropriations for program areas and funds appropriated by agencies to each CFDA program. Because of this, the consistency metric is a measure of consistency between two federal funding sources and not an accuracy measurement, as it would be if it could be reliably compared to the budget. 
</p>

<p>
Federal loans and loan guarantees are clear outliers of the data represented on Clearspending. A significant portion of federal spending goes to direct loans, loan guarantees and other types of insurance. In general, reporting systems (including USASpending.gov) focus on the subsidy rate, or the actual money spent on securing lower interest rates or other fees. The total value of the loans and guarantees is reported as well but is generally not considered to be an expenditure unless a default occurs. The loan data in USASpending.gov is of substantially lower quality than the grant data. It is often the case that only defaults are reported despite the reporting of all loans being a requirement under the Federal Financial Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA). Because loan data is sparse, it is not included in our timeliness metric and is considered separately in our consistency metric. Aggregate figures for the consistency measurement do not include loans and loan guarantees, but these figures are available in the program detail view. Since only the face value of the loan is reliably available in both CFDA and USASpending.gov we use this figure in our analysis and not the subsidy rate.
</p>

<h4>Consistency</h4>
<p>
The consistency metric is a comparison between two annual federal obligations figures. The first is an obligation estimate that is reported annually by each program to the Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance. The second is an aggregate of obligations reported by each program to USASpending.gov, by fiscal year. Obligations are taken from the full CFDA program directory located on the CFDA's FTP server (ftp://ftp.cfda.gov/). The weighted difference in the obligations from both sources is used as the primary indicator of consistency. Programs that report obligations in the CFDA but do not have any records in USASpending are designated as nonreporting and are not used when calculating the variance of underreporting or overreporting programs. Programs that report some, but not all, obligations in USASpending are designated as underreporting programs , and those that report more in USASpending than in the CFDA are overreporting programs. Statistics for underreporting and overreporting programs are calculated separately. Since CFDA program obligations are annual estimates, there are very few programs whose reported CFDA obligation is exactly equal to the aggregate obligations in USASpending.gov. As a result, there is a natural variation of underreporting and overreporting that occurs. The programs with the closest numbers in their reporting generally have a variation of about 25% of the program's total funding. The colors of the consistency metrics indicate the performance of a program or agency with regard to a specific consistency measurement (over, under or non reporting). Programs or agencies that misreport between 0 and 25% of their total program value are considered good and are highlighted in green. Those that misreported between 25% and 50% are considered average and are highlighted in yellow, and those that misreport more than 50% of their total program value are highlighted in red and are considered to be performing poorly.
</p>
<p>
Some CFDA programs have had manual corrections made to their CFDA obligation amounts. In cases where we saw obvious order of magnitude errors (e.g. reporting in millions instead billions) we corrected the obligation to allow for a more telling analysis. All corrections are listed on the corrections page with the original and current recorded obligations and a note. Programs wishing to update their CFDA obligation amount may either update it in CFDA and wait for our process to subsequently update, or they may contact us directly using the contact form.
</p>

<p>
Only certain types of programs are present in this analysis. Many CFDA programs provide non-financial services, which may include dissemination of information, investigation of complaints, and advisory or counselling services. These programs may report obligations in the CFDA obligation field, but they are almost always designated as salaries and are ignored for the sake of this analysis. The programs with the following assistance types <em>are</em> included: 
    <ol>
        <li>Formula Grants</li>
        <li>Project Grants</li>
        <li>Direct Payments for a Specified Use</li>
        <li>Direct Payments with Unrestricted Use</li>
        <li>Direct Loans</li>
        <li>Guaranteed/Insured Loans</li>
        <li>Insurance</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
Note that in the results, programs that provide mixed assistance, relying on both grants and loans, will be split and have a listing for both grant reporting and loan/loan guarantee reporting. This is because the reporting guidances on loan obligations are not as concrete as those for grants and previous research on this topic has led us to believe they should be considered separately. Additionally, some grant programs included designate certain obligations reported in the CFDA as salaries. These obligations are ignored in this analysis. Additionally, FFATA does not require that grants to individual recipients be reported. As a result, many programs have been designated as nonreporting, such as Social Security payments, Medicare insurance, direct small business loans and unemployment insurance payments. While these programs are still in compliance with the law, their sheer magnitude warrants a look at what portion of the budget is not being reported.

<h4>Completeness</h4>
<p>
To measure the completeness of the records in USASpending.gov, each record was systematically checked to see if it contained well-formatted data for 18 specific fields required by FFATA. Some fields were only checked to see if they contained any value. Other fields were checked for formatting and validity. The fields checked for content include:
    <ol>
        <li>Recipient Type</li>
        <li>Recipient Name</li>
        <li>Recipient State Code</li>
        <li>Recipient County Code</li>
        <li>Recipient County Name</li>
        <li>Recipient City Code</li>
        <li>Recipient City Name</li>
        <li>Recipient Congressional District</li>
        <li>Record Type</li>
        <li>Action Type</li>
        <li>Assistance Type</li>
        <li>Federal Award ID</li>
        <li>Principal Place of Performance County Code</li>
        <li>Principal Place of Performance State Code</li>
        <li>Federal Agency Code</li>
        <li>Federal Funding Amount</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
The obligation action date field was checked for content and checked for proper date formatting. The CFDA program number was also checked for a properly formatted CFDA number and excluded common placeholders that appear in the data (such as 00.000 and MU.LTI). For each record that failed to complete one of these fields, the total obligated funds for that record were added to a running total of obligations failing to meet the reporting standard. Programs with less than 95% of their obligations being reported completely are considered poorly performing programs and are designated in red on the scorecard. All others are considered well performing and are shown in green.
</p>

<h4>Timeliness</h4>
<p>
The timeliness metric measures the time between the obligation and the obligation reporting to USASpending.gov. The obligation date is a FFATA mandated field. It is also a FFATA requirement that all obligations be reported to USASpending.gov within 30 days. The reported date appears in the name of the data files that individual agencies submit to USASpending.gov. These files are posted on the USASpending.gov site so that the original agency submitted data is available. The date is then parsed out of the file name and compared with the obligation date of the transactions present in that particular file. Transactions that appear in multiple files, either as corrections or updates, are only counted the first time they appear. Transactions that do not appear in any of the available agency files are not measured. If the difference between the obligated date and the reported date is greater than 45 days, the obligation for that transaction is counted as late and added to a running total of late obligations. Programs that have less than 90% of their obligations reported within 45 days are considered poorly performing programs and are highlighted in red. All others are considered well performing and highlighted in green.
