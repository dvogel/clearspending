        <h3>Keeping Tabs on <span>USASpending.gov</span></h3>
        <p>We've taken data from other federal reporting systems and compared it with just the <em>grants</em> data found in USASpending.gov across three categories: Consistency, Completeness and Timeliness. How close are the reported dollar amounts to the yearly estimates? How many of the required fields are filled out in each record? And how long did it take the agency to report the money once it was allocated to a project?</p>
