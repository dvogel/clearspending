It's pretty straightforward: tests go into the metrics/ folder (except for this file, I've tried to avoid use of the word "test" since it's pretty well spoken for).  

Just create test functions that:

  - have either the @boolean, @real or @integer decorator
  - are prepared to accept a dict containing the fields for a FAADS row
  - and return the appropriate value
  
CSVs are passed to scorecard.py on STDIN.  The script emits a pickled version of the result object, which supplies some basic statistics, binned by CFDA program and test, as well as frequency count data for integer fields.

Still TBD: a reduce/merge script for those pickled files.  But that should be trivial -- the hardest part will be summing the means and standard deviations, and that's not particularly difficult.
